### Q1
P1 randomizes over pure strategies L and R
E(P2_Left) = E(P2_Right)
4P + 6(1-P) = 5P + 3(1-P)
-2P + 6 = 2P + 3
3 = 4P
P = 3/4

### Q2
Both players can play left or right
X,2 | 0,0
0,0 | 2,2

How does P = probability p1 plays L change as Q = probability of p2 L changes?
p1 strategizes over pure strategies L and R
E(p1 L) = E(p1 R)
Xp + 0 = 0 + 2(1-p)
Xp = 2 - 2p
Xp + 2p = 2

As X increases, p decreases

### Q3
two people, p1 and p2 apply to two firms f1,f2 with wages w1,w2
if both apply to same, one is chosen randomly, other gets 0 pay

w1 = 4, w2 = 6

   f1  | f2
f1 2,2 | 4,6
f2 6,4 | 3,3

mixed strategy nash equilibria
P(p1 applies to f1) is given as p
E(p2 applies to f1) = E(p2 applies to f2)
2p + 6(1-p) = 4p + 3(1-p)
2p - 6p + 6 = 4p - 3p + 3
-4p + 6 = p + 3
3 = 5p
p = 3/5

### Q4

2 places the king can hide the treasure are (X or Y) or Z
2 places the pirate can look are (X and Y) or Z
This is the penny matching problem with different utilities
(Pirate, King)

   XY  | _Z
XY 9,2 | 4,5
_Z 4,5 | 9,2

p = probability king places treasure in XY in nash equilibrium
E(pirate looks XY) = E(pirate looks Z)
2p + 5(1-p) = 5p + 2(1-p)
2p + 5 - 5p = 5p + 2 - 2p
-3p + 5 = 3p + 2
3 = 6p
p = 1/2

q = probability pirate looks in XY
E(king places XY) = E(king places Z)
9p + 4(1-p) = 4p + 9(1-p)
9p + 4 - 4p = 4p + 9 - 9p
5p + 4 = -5p + 9
10p = 5
p = 1/2
(meant to use q here)

### Q5

Here the pirate can now choose any 2 places to search.

   X   | Y   | Z
XY 9,2 | 9,2 | 4,5 
YZ 4,5 | 9,2 | 9,2 
XZ 9,2 | 4,5 | 9,2

dont know how i can compute this, but uniformly random should be the
nash equilibrium
