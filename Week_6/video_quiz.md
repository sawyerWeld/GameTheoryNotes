## #1

3(p) + 0(p-1) = 3p

b) 3p when 1 chooses left

## #2

Player 1 chooses Fight when strong(p) and Not when weak(1-p).

Player 2's payoff for chosing Fight is -2p + 2(1-p) = -2p+2-2p = 2-4p

Player 2's payoff for chosing Not is -1p + 0(1-p) = -1p

We would like to solve find a p such that player 2's payoff is equal given the two types.

- 2 = 3p
- 2/3 = p
- p = 2/3
