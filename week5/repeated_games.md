## Repeated Games

Repeated games are games that are played repeatedly over time. The example given is as follows:
Members of OPEC sell lots of oil for cheap. If they all agreed to pump less oil they could drive up the price. But, if one member cheated a bit and produced more than agreed upon, that member would make more money. If enough people do this, the alliance falls apart and everyone makes less money. This is much like a repeated prisoner's dilemma.

## Utility in Infinitely Repeated Games

The game that is being played repeatedly is called the 'stage game.' Each player gets a sequence of payoffs which are their utilities from each play of the stage game. We can't use extensive form or a sum because the extensive form would be inifinite (there would be no leaf nodes) and we cant use the sum because it would be unbounded. There are two ways utility gets defined in repeated play:

Averate reward. The limit as k approaches 0 of the sum from j to 
\sum_{j=1}^k{\frac{r_j}{k}}
