## 1_5 Quiz

Consider a trivial welfare function W in which nature has already determined that the correct welfare function is (A,B,C). 

### #1

Is W pareto efficient?

No. If the agents would create a scenario in which an outcome other than A is preferred to every thing else, the welfare function still picks A.

### #2 

Is W IIA?

I think yes, trivially.

### #3

Is W dictitorial?

No? There is no agent which W copies. W uses no agent input.
