## Final Exam for Course 2

### #1

Consider the following (true) preference orderings or 4 agents over 4 candidates:

```
Agent 1: A>B>C>D
Agent 2: B>C>D>A
Agent 3: C>B>D>A
Agent 4: D>C>A>B
```

Assume that agents 2,3, and 4 are truthful while agent 1 may or may not be truthful in reporting her preference ordering. Under Borda Rule, find the best response of agent 1 among the given strategy profiles. Ties are broken alphabetically.

Among the following three orderings, which one achieves the best outcome for agent 1?
```
Borda Counts before Agent 1 votes
					
                    A B C D
Agent 2: B>C>D>A    0 3 2 1
Agent 3: C>B>D>A    0 5 5 2
Agent 4: D>C>A>B    1 5 7 5

Case 1
Agent 1: B>A>D>C    3 8 7 6  => B wins

Case 1
Agent 1: C>D>A>B    2 5 10 7 => C wins

Case 1
Agent 1: A>B>C>D    4 7 8 5  => C Wins
```

Agent 1 has the power to make B or C win, so it should chose option 1 to make B win.

- B > A > D > C
