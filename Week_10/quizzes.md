Consider the follwing 2 components of voting:

- A) voter's preferences
- B) the voting rule

When designing a voting mechanism, the designer gets to specify 

- Only B

## #2

Consider a Bayesian game and a social choice function C

Let DS be the set containing all mechanisms that are implementations in dominant strategies of C and BN be the set containing all mechanisms that are implementations in Bayes-Nash equilibrium of C.

Which of the following is true?

- DS is always a subset of BN.

## #1

Consider one mechanism M being the mapping from actions to outcomes and let si() be the equilibrium strategy for player i in this mechanism. 

Which of the folling M' is a truthful and direct mechanism (assuming the action space is the type space)?

- M' = M(s1(.),...,sn(.))

## #1

Which of the following about the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem is NOT true?

- It considers both the dominant strategy implementation and the Bayes-Nash implementation.

# Unit 2.8 Quiz

## #1

Consider a game with 2 players θ = (θ1, θ2), and let the outcome o = (x,p) = ((x1,x2),(p1,p2))

Players have quasilinear preferences with transferable utility u1(θ,o).

Which of the following is NOT true?

- u1(θ,o) can depend on p2.

## #2

As above, but the players hae private values.

Which of the following is true?

- u1(θ,o) can depend on x2.

# Unit 2.9 Quiz

## #1

Which of the following understandings is clearly incorrect?

- An efficient mechanism selects the choice that maximizes the sum of agents' utilities, including monetary payments.

Efficiency ignores monetary payments, so this is not true.

## #2

Consider a game with three players (1,2,3) and 4 outcomes (a,b,c,d). Players' payoffs from each outcome and listed below.

| Player | a   | b   | c   | d   |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1      | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| 2      | 4   | 3   | 1   | 2   |
| 3      | 2   | 4   | 2   | 2   |

Which of the outcomes is efficient?

- b is efficient 

b has the highest average utility so it is efficient
