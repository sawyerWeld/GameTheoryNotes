### 1. Consider the following normal form:
|Player1\Player2| Movie | Theater |
|--|--| --|
| Movie | a,b | 0,0 |
| Theater | 0,0 | c,d |

 - P1 prefers to see a movie over going to the theater
 - P2 prefers going to the theater over seeing a movie
 - They'd both rather be together
 - Therefore a > c, b < d

### 2. Consider the following constant sum game:
|  | H | T |
|--|--|--|
| H | 1,-1 |  |
| T |  | 0,? |
- What is ?
- For the game to be constant sum, ? = 0

### 3. n people guess an integer between 1 and 100, and the winner is the player whose guess is closest to the mean of the guesses + 1 (ties broken randomly). Which of the following is an equilibrium:

 - All 1
 - All 50
 - All 75
 - All 100
 - ? :(
