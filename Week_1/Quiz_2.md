### 1. Consider the following normal form:
|Player1\Player2| Movie | Theater |
|--|--| --|
| Movie | a,b | 0,0 |
| Theater | 0,0 | c,d |

 - P1 prefers to see a movie over going to the theater
 - P2 prefers going to the theater over seeing a movie
 - They'd both rather be together
 - Therefore a > c, b < d
