# Week 1 Notes

## Nash Equilibrium
A set of actions from all players in which no agent can improve their utility by deviating from their selected action.
- Prisoner's Delima

| (A,B) | C | D |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C |-1,-1 | -4,0 |
| D | 0,-4 | **-3,-3** |
- If I am A I always want to Defect. Defecting when the other person doesn't means I get 0 instead of -1. Defecting when the other person defects means I get -3 instead of -4.
