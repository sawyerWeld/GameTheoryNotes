There isn't all that much to this unit. A brief explanation of what VCG is and the quizzes should suffice.

## What is VCG?

The Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism always chooses the action that produces the greatest sum utility among agents.

The payment given to an agent i is given by

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=p_i(\hat{v})&space;=&space;h_i(\hat{v}_{-i})&space;-&space;\sum_{j\not=i}\hat{v}_j(x(\hat{v}))" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p_i(\hat{v})&space;=&space;h_i(\hat{v}_{-i})&space;-&space;\sum_{j\not=i}\hat{v}_j(x(\hat{v}))" title="p_i(\hat{v}) = h_i(\hat{v}_{-i}) - \sum_{j\not=i}\hat{v}_j(x(\hat{v}))" /></a>

This is the difference between two parts. The first part

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=h_i(\hat{v}_{-i})" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?h_i(\hat{v}_{-i})" title="h_i(\hat{v}_{-i})" /></a>

is the utility agent i recieves from the mechanism.

The second part 

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\sum_{j\not=i}\hat{v}_j(x(\hat{v}))" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sum_{j\not=i}\hat{v}_j(x(\hat{v}))" title="\sum_{j\not=i}\hat{v}_j(x(\hat{v}))" /></a>

is the sum utility every agent other than i receieves if agent i is removed from the mechanism.

## Unit 3.2 Quiz

Three agents run the VCG mechanism to decide whether or not to build an airport. Their reports are:

| Agent | U(Build) | U(Don't) |
| ----- | -------- | -------- |
| 1     | 0        | 60       |
| 2     | 45       | 15       |
| 3     | 45       | 5        |

### #1

What outcome will VCG choose given the above report?

- VCG will choose to build. U(Build) has a sum utility of 90, U(Don't) has 80. VCG chooses the option with highest sum utility.

### #2

What is agent 2's payment?

In VCG, the payment to an agent is given by
