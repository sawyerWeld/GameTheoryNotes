# Auctions

There are several types of auctions analyzed in this module.

### First-Price
In this sealed-bid auction (sealed-bid meaning the agents submit their bids simultaneously without seeing each other's bids). The agent who bids the most wins the auction and pays however much they bid.

### Second-Price
Similar to a first-price auction, however the agent pays however much the second higher bidder bid. The expected outcome is the same as first-price auction, however in this case telling the truth is a dominant strategy. This is a VCG mechanism.

### All-Pay
Same as first-price, however every agent pays what they bid.

### Dutch
The sale price starts very high and is slowly lowered. The first person to claim it wins the auction and pays the sale price.

### English
The price starts at zero or some reserve price. Bidders increase the price by some minimum bid or they can choose to play a jump-bid, bidding more than the minimum bid. At some point nobody bids any more and the auction is won by the most recent bidder.
